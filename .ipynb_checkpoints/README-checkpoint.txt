# Notes
Please note that the notebooks/code isn't the best documented; that's because up until the last moment I've been trying things, changing things and generally breaking things in order to make them actually work. As such, I'd recommend that you read my report on the project before really diving into anything, as I think that the report does a decently good job of documenting things (at least things that I remember). I'd also like to note that I don't plan to end this project after this class, and will most likely work on it for a bit moving forward. Fractional Ito Motion is something that I personally believe in to change the structure of diffusion models, but who knows how it'll end up working out. My main goal right now is to try and figure out a way to recover the hurst parameter from FIM; simulations have looksed somewhat promising, and I think that the way I've constructed the multifractional generalization of ito motion here will end up working out, even if it needs some tweaks.
